## 1. Create Environment 

Our project uses python virtual env named "ciga". To create the environment and install the dependencies, run: 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

#### 1b. (Optional) Install direnv

https://direnv.net/

This tool automatically activates the "ciga" virtual environment when you navigate your project folder, and deactivates it if you navigate away from the folder. If you want to use it, install it using instructions from the website.

You may have to run `direnv allow .` the first time (or whenever .envrc changes, which shouldn't be often if ever). 

## 2. Download data
(instructions for running script(s) to download the datasets)
